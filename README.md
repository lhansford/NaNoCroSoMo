NaNoCroSoMo
===========
NaNoCroSoMo (National Novel Crowd Sourcing Month) is a take on NaNoWriMo inspired by the work of those mentioned in the recent Verge article covering the work of a number of programmers trying to use algorithms to generate novels. My implementation meets somewhere in the middle of these two. Every thirty seconds a computer generated word is added to the story. This word is selected using n-grams taken from the Google Books corpus.

To add a human element, however, anyone can add their own word. Simply type a word and hit enter to add it to the story.
